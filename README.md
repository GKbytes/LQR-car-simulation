# Linear-quadratic regulator car simulation
Motion simulation of a real car using linear-quadratic regulator. The point of implementing the LQR method was to generate the data which could later be used for training the neural network in similiar conditions. This was because there was no possibility to collect that data from the physical drivers just as it is done commercially.
